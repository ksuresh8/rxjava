java.util.function
Interface BiFunction<T,U,R>
Type Parameters:
T - the type of the first argument to the function
U - the type of the second argument to the function
R - the type of the result of the function
All Known Subinterfaces:
BinaryOperator<T>
Functional Interface:
This is a functional interface and can therefore be used as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference.

@FunctionalInterface
public interface BiFunction<T,U,R>
Represents a function that accepts two arguments and produces a result. This is the two-arity specialization of Function.
This is a functional interface whose functional method is apply(Object, Object).

Since:
1.8

Modifier and Type	Method and Description
default <V> BiFunction<T,U,V>	andThen(Function<? super R,? extends V> after)
Returns a composed function that first applies this function to its input, and then applies the after function to the result.
R	apply(T t, U u)
Applies this function to the given arguments.
Method Detail
apply
R apply(T t,
        U u)
Applies this function to the given arguments.
Parameters:
t - the first function argument
u - the second function argument
Returns:
the function result
andThen
default <V> BiFunction<T,U,V> andThen(Function<? super R,? extends V> after)
Returns a composed function that first applies this function to its input, and then applies the after function to the result. If evaluation of either function throws an exception, it is relayed to the caller of the composed function.
Type Parameters:
V - the type of output of the after function, and of the composed function
Parameters:
after - the function to apply after this function is applied
Returns:
a composed function that first applies this function and then applies the after function
Throws:
NullPointerException - if after is null
